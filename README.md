# Wiz Development
This is the repository for the development of Wiz.

## Folder Descriptions

### datasets
Many simple datasets used in developing Wiz and in the examples of Wiz.

### deploy
The deployment folder has all of the files necessary to host on different platforms. There is more information on deploying in each platform in the guides.

### src
This is all of the necessary source code for Wiz. The documentation for the structure of the Wiz code is in the Wiki page.

To run an individual instance of Wiz on a local machine, one simply executes ``index.py`` as follows.

``python3 index.py``

The app will then be hosted locally at port 5000 (currently). For example, that means that once the command window is running the code, then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the result.
